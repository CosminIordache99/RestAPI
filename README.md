# RestAPI

While working on this RESTfull API, I used Repository with Unit of Work design pattern that promotes good coding practices, simplifies testing, and allows for easier changes to the underlying data access layer without affecting the rest of the application. It provides a standardized way of accessing data and groups database operations into a single transaction, resulting in better performance and maintainability of the codebase.As for the ORM I used Entitty Framework for faster hands on configurations of transactions with the database
